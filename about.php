    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website was created during Space Apps Challenge 2017 hackathon in Armenia. We are 2 students from Moscow State University, Yerevan branch.<br></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concept of this project is uniting all data connected with definitions of Earth-related scientific and technical terms. Our audience are not only astronomers, but also ordinary people, who are interested in the wonders of science. <br></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you can search all the “jargon” terms NASA Earth scientists and engineers use every day to talk about their work. Also you can suggest words, that are not included in our databases, or if you found a mistake - let us know about it. For your activity you will be granted with badges. Feel free to comment and share your opinion with all users. </p>
